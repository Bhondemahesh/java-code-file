/*Write a program that accepts two numbers in the range from 1 to 40 from the Command Line. It then compares these numbers against a single dimension array of five integer elements ranging in value from 1 to 40. The program displays the message BINGO if the two inputted values are found in the array element. For example:
input>java prob3 3 29
output>Your first number was 3
Your second number was 29
Its Bingo! // this message if 3 and 29 is found in the array
Not Found! // this message if 3 and 29 is not found in the         //array
The array was 7 25 5 19 30
